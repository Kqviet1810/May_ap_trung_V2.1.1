# 03 — FAULT / ALARM MATRIX

Source of truth: `faultDescriptor()` table (machine_control.h:440-519) cross-checked
against every `faults_.set()` call site and against the actual consumers
(`updateHeatingAndOutputs`, `updateTurning`). Evidence: **STATIC**.

Legend: SSR = inhibitSsr · MST = dropHeatMaster · TRN = inhibitsTurning ·
VNT = forceVentFan · CIR = forceCirculationFan · L = latching.

`✓*` = **declared in the table but NOT effective while a batch is running** — see
finding F-04. `dropHeatMaster` is consumed only through
`req.immediateMasterDrop`, and `OutputArbiter::update()` reads that field only
inside the `if (!request.heatMaster …)` branch. During a batch with the physical
heater switch ON, `request.heatMaster` is `true`, so the drop request is never
evaluated. Rows marked `✓*` therefore inhibit the SSR only. E112 still drops the
contactor because `normalMasterPermit` itself contains `!emergencyActive_`.

## Alarm-system checks demanded by §20

* **MISSING ALARM** — frozen/constant sensor value is not detected (F-07).
  No alarm for "automatic turning has produced no completed turn for N intervals"
  independent of E202/E205 (covered operationally by F-02).
* **FALSE ALARM** — none found. Every condition has a confirm timer or streak.
* **WRONG CAUSE** — none found; `detail` fields carry the measured value.
* **DUPLICATE ALARM** — E120/E121 deliberately share `AlarmHumidityLow`; distinct
  codes, distinct text. Not a defect.
* **ALARM MASKING** — `FaultManager::slot()` reuses the last slot when 32 slots are
  exhausted; 34 codes now exist, so in the pathological case where all 32 slots are
  occupied a 33rd code overwrites slot 31. Reaching that state requires 32 distinct
  faults to have been *seen* (slots are allocated on first `set()`, including
  `set(code,false)`, and never freed). Several codes are only ever set on their
  active edge, so exhaustion is not demonstrable from static reading → recorded as
  UNKNOWN U-02.
* **ALARM CLEARS TOO EARLY** — no. `set(code,false)` on a latching fault returns
  early unless already acknowledged.
* **ALARM NEVER CLEARS** — E205 requires Test Mode, unreachable during a batch (F-02).
* **ACK CLEARS ACTIVE ROOT CAUSE** — `FaultManager::acknowledge()` only calls
  `clearState()` when `state.condition` is already false, so acknowledging does not
  clear a live condition. The exception is `clearTurnFault()`, which *forces*
  `condition=false` for the latched turn code after checking only the limit and
  manual-turn inputs — it does not prove the mechanism works (F-08 covers the
  remote-ACK aspect; the streak counter + E205 is the intended compensation).
